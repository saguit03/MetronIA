This 3-movement suite is arguably the composer's best known work. The original 1921 composition consisted of the 2nd and 3rd Movements only, and the 1st Movement was added by the composer years later. The premiere of the Suite (w/ all 3 movements) took place in San Salvador, 1938, performed by the composer himself.

This is the 2nd Movement in the 3 Movements suite. Moderately paced, its sound resembles the sound of bells of the Catedral tower.

Danza Americana",,,bHRRaRx3olo,114,220,arcas-la-cubana,,dSswc,"Julián Arcas - ""La Cubana"" | Classical Guitar | Played by Jonathan Richter","""La Cubana"" (""The Cuban Lady"") by Spanish composer Julián Arcas (1832-1882) is a beautiful guitar piece in the key of D major.

The liner notes include the text ""Danza Americana para guitarra"" and ""Aire de tango"". This implies that the rhythm should be relatively upbeat, in duple meter. 

The beginning La Cubana has a repeating syncopated bass line similar to the popular Spanish piece ""La Paloma"". Above the bouncing bass line is a clear and distinctive melody, which I think sounds best when not played on open strings. 

The piece has an opening theme section which repeats, and then evolves into a larger A section. 

After the 2nd repeat of the entire A section, the piece modulates to the key of G major for the B section. Following other brief modulations to the keys of A minor and D major, Arcas weaves the music back to the key of G major for a delightful conclusion.

About the composer:

""Johann Sebastian Bach (31 March [O.S. 21 March] 1685 – 28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period. He enriched established German styles through his mastery of counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and his adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include the Brandenburg Concertos, the Goldberg Variations, the Mass in B minor, two Passions, and over three hundred cantatas of which approximately two hundred survive. His music is revered for its technical command, artistic beauty, and intellectual depth."" (Wikipedia)

Six Pavans by Luis de Milán (c.1500-1561) - Originally for vihuela. Sheet Music arranged for Classical Guitar with Notation-Only Edition, TAB Edition, and Unfingered Edition. Regular guitar tuning. Mixed levels (see link).

The six pavans (pavanes, or pavanas) by Luis de Milán (c.1500-1561), also Luys Milán, come from his Libro de música de vihuela de mano intitulado El Maestro (1536). One of the first published music collections for the vihuela de mano. There are many editions of this music available but this edition focuses on voice leading and legato connection in imitation of vocal works of the era. Low quality editions often ignore the vocal quality and complexity of the music resulting in fingering choices that simplify the music to the point chord playing. This edition has been fingered specifically to create beautiful musical lines and voice independence. This doesn't always make for easy fingerings but the musical result is worth it.

Em 1993 Anssi Vanjoki, vice-presidente executivo da Nokia, mostrou Gran Vals a Lauri Kivinen, chefe de assuntos corporativos, e juntos seleccionaram um fragmento dessa linda obra para se tornar o toque ""Nokia tune"". Estima-se que esse toque seja reproduzido mais de 2 bilhoes de vez por dia Oo
Uma fantastica valsa que faz jus ao titulo. Baseada nas obras do tb famoso pianista e compositor Frédéric Chopin, que tem suas obras sempre vivas e inseridas em trilhas de excelentes desenhos como: Tom & Jerry e muitos outros.

I am proud to announce the first recording of Maria Linnemann's ""SOLEDAD""!
Maria composed this music this year and decided to dedicate it to me. It's a great honor!
When I asked her what's behind the piece she told me:
""It was inspired by a poem written by a poet of the '27 generation', Emilio Prados. Many poets fled Spain at the time of the civil war, and found a new home in S. America or Mexico. But they homesick, and their poems reflect their sadness. Prados' poem is called 'Cancion', and begins: Puente de mi soledad: con las aguas di mi muerte tus ojos se calmaran....'.

Carulli's Etude No.5, Op.241 is one of my favorites to play and teach beginner classical guitarists. 

Carulli's Op.241 is an edited version of his successful ""Methode Op. 27"", which went through several iterations during his lifetime. This guitar etude is great for practicing multiple notes played at the same time, bringing out clear melodic line, and practicing intricate arpeggios in the key of G major.

Hi everyone,
  finally sometime to record some new pieces.. Haven't really worked on this for a long time but it is one of my favorite pieces.  Actually bought this during GFA fair.  Summer has been really great !!!  Few concerts and sharing with my dad... Got press coverage in Malaysia too and went on TV with my dad playing a Jongo.  Sadly though I was down with a mild case of Chick Pox despite being vaccinated.   My Rode NT4 microphone holder broke down too.  See link ...

Manuel Ponce was a Mexican composer active in the 20th century. His work as a composer, music educator and scholar of Mexican music connected the concert scene with a usually forgotten tradition of popular song and Mexican folklore. Many of his compositions are strongly influenced by the harmonies and form of traditional songs.",Kevin Loh - Classical Guitarist,16595,yt_thumbnails/eugI6lnktUA.jpg,,Manuel Maria Ponce (1882-1948),,Manuel Maria Ponce (1882-1948),Manuel Maria Ponce,0.89,0.89,Manuel Maria Ponce,https://imslp.org/wiki/Category%3APonce%2C%20Manuel,Mexican,1882,1948,Kevin Loh,male,Malaysian,"{'website': 'http://www.kevinloh.net/', 'facebook': 'https://www.facebook.com/KevinLoh.Guitar'}"

Six Pavans by Luis de Milán (c.1500-1561) - Originally for vihuela. Sheet Music arranged for Classical Guitar with Notation-Only Edition, TAB Edition, and Unfingered Edition. Regular guitar tuning. Mixed levels (see link).

The six pavans (pavanes, or pavanas) by Luis de Milán (c.1500-1561), also Luys Milán, come from his Libro de música de vihuela de mano intitulado El Maestro (1536). One of the first published music collections for the vihuela de mano. There are many editions of this music available but this edition focuses on voice leading and legato connection in imitation of vocal works of the era. Low quality editions often ignore the vocal quality and complexity of the music resulting in fingering choices that simplify the music to the point chord playing. This edition has been fingered specifically to create beautiful musical lines and voice independence. This doesn't always make for easy fingerings but the musical result is worth it.

 Classical guitars are our passion! We are specialized in the highest quality concert guitars as well as historic guitars from around the world. Our passion for these unique instruments and the joy to give guitarists, passionate players, and collectors the possibility to purchase their own appropriate instrument is the motivation that drives us. Another focus is to work closely with established and young, largely unknown luthiers. Together we want to develop new ideas and share experiences with our customers. We also recorded pieces for many great composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Astor Piazzolla and Isaac Albeniz (Asturias). You will also find almost all the classical music composers that wrote for the classical guitar. Make sure to discover Agustin Barrios Mangoré, Manuel Maria Ponce, Heitor Villa-Lobos and many more if you don't know their compositions already You can find our showroom in 76137 Karlsruhe, Roonstr. 31, Germany

Miguel Llobet Solés est un compositeur et  guitariste espagnol (Barcelone, 1878-1938). On lui doit les premiers enregistrements (avec Augustin Barrios) de guitare classique, réalisés dès 1925. Il était reconnu comme un éminent virtuose qui se produisit régulièrement sur les scènes européenne et américaine. 

Le titre de la pièce, ""Leonesa"", fait probablement allusion à une illustre guitare de Antonio de Torres, la FE4,  construite en 1856, autrement dit ""La Leona"".

Autre hypothèse: Rogelio Villar,  compositeur, musicologue et professeur espagnol, est né à Léon.  Il a été élève de Zabalza au Conservatoire de Madrid et a obtenu en 1918 la chaire de Musique de Chambre dans cette institution entre 1919 et 1936. 
 Il a fait des recherches sur la musique folklorique de la région de Léon et a utilisé des rythmes et des mélodies populaires dans toute sa production.  Les airs nostalgiques de ses compositions lui ont valu le surnom de "" Grieg espagnol ». Il a en outre publié cinq cahiers de Chansons de Léon (Canciones Leonesas)... d'où l'explication du titre de l'adaptation de Miguel Llobet? 

Joué sur un modèle Torres/ Played on a  guitarTorres model

An other piece, harmonized in 1910 approximately, by Miguel Llobet, on the basis of a popular song of Rogelio Villar (1875-1937)
Miguel Llobet Solés (18 October 1878 -- 22 February 1938) was a classical guitarist, born in Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain). Llobet was a renowned virtuoso who toured Europe and America extensively. He made well known arrangements of Catalan folk songs for the solo guitar and is also the composer of original works.

The title, ""Leonesa"", probably alludes to a famous guitar of Antonio de Torres, the FE4, built in 1856, in other words ""La Leona""

Another assumption: Rogelio Villar, composer, musicologist and Spanish professor, was born in Léon.  It was raises of Zabalza in the Academy of Madrid and obtained in 1918 the pulpit of Chamber music in this institution between 1919 and 1936.
It made research on the folk music of the area of Léon and used popular rhythms and melodies in all its production.  The nostalgic airs of its compositions were worth the nickname of ""Spanish Grieg"". Did it moreover publish five books of  Léon's Songs (Canciones Leonesas)... from where the explanation of the title of the adaptation of Miguel Llobet?",44guitares,6956,yt_thumbnails/5NrHAqjhA9A.jpg,,Miguel Llobet (1878-1938),,Miguel Llobet (1878-1938),Miguel Llobet,0.85,0.85,Miguel Llobet,https://imslp.org/wiki/Category%3ALlobet%2C%20Miguel,Spanish,1878,1938,Unknown,male,,

The six pavans (pavanes, or pavanas) by Luis de Milán (c.1500-1561), also Luys Milán, come from his Libro de música de vihuela de mano intitulado El Maestro (1536). One of the first published music collections for the vihuela de mano. There are many editions of this music available but this edition focuses on voice leading and legato connection in imitation of vocal works of the era. Low quality editions often ignore the vocal quality and complexity of the music resulting in fingering choices that simplify the music to the point chord playing. This edition has been fingered specifically to create beautiful musical lines and voice independence. This doesn't always make for easy fingerings but the musical result is worth it.

►Guitar: https://www.siccasguitars.com/shop/guitar/antonio-marin-montero-2019/

Antonio Marín Montero was born in Granada in 1933. In 1957, he joined master Pérez’s workshop and two years later, in 1959, his father advised him to visit Eduardo Ferrer for whom he worked until opening his own workshop. Today Antonio Marin Montero is one of the most sought after Granadian guitar makers.
This guitar is brand-new and as always with Antonio Marin Montero’s guitars, it is a fantastic concert instrument in the Spanish tradition. It has a remarkable balance and a wide range of sound colours. The deep rounded basses unite perfectly with the overtone-rich trebles and the sound has a great charm and openness. Overall, it is a beautiful guitar that will please the ears and the heart of its lucky owner and his audience.

Classical guitars are our passion! We are specialized in the highest quality concert guitars as well as historic guitars from around the world. Our passion for these unique instruments and the joy to give guitarists, passionate players, and collectors the possibility to purchase their own appropriate instrument is the motivation that drives us. Another focus is to work closely with established and young, largely unknown luthiers. Together we want to develop new ideas and share experiences with our customers. 

We also recorded pieces for many great composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Astor Piazzolla and Isaac Albeniz (Asturias). You will also find almost all the classical music composers that wrote for the classical guitar. Make sure to discover Agustin Barrios Mangoré, Manuel Maria Ponce, Heitor Villa-Lobos and many more if you don't know their compositions already

You can find our show room in 76137 Karlsruhe, Roonstr. 31, Germany

Jim Redgate is a highly sought-after Australian luthier, known for his guitars built for artists such as Ana Vidovic, Pepe Roméro and Odair Assad. This lattice-braced model is an exact copy of the guitar that Ana Vidovic plays. Jim Redgate’s instruments have their own sound and touch. The breath-taking volume combined with rich harmonics and impressive clarity of sound are quite unique. The playability is fantastic, and the guitars are relatively light in weight compared to the Australian standard.
We’ve of course heard Ana Vidovic in concert many times playing on a Redgate guitar, but this guitar convinced us even more of the quality of Jim’s work. The honesty and spontaneity of each note, the magnificent volume, the ease of playing, and the unique sound character of this guitar make it an instrument not only rare in Europe, but above all extremely enchanting.

 Classical guitars are our passion! We are specialized in the highest quality concert guitars as well as historic guitars from around the world. Our passion for these unique instruments and the joy to give guitarists, passionate players, and collectors the possibility to purchase their own appropriate instrument is the motivation that drives us. Another focus is to work closely with established and young, largely unknown luthiers. Together we want to develop new ideas and share experiences with our customers. We also recorded pieces for many great composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Astor Piazzolla and Isaac Albeniz (Asturias). You will also find almost all the classical music composers that wrote for the classical guitar. Make sure to discover Agustin Barrios Mangoré, Manuel Maria Ponce, Heitor Villa-Lobos and many more if you don't know their compositions already You can find our showroom in 76137 Karlsruhe, Roonstr. 31, Germany

Six Pavans by Luis de Milán (c.1500-1561) - Originally for vihuela. Sheet Music arranged for Classical Guitar with Notation-Only Edition, TAB Edition, and Unfingered Edition. Regular guitar tuning. Mixed levels (see link).

3:04 Pavana No.3

6:13 Pavana No.5 
7:14 Pavana No.6

The six pavans (pavanes, or pavanas) by Luis de Milán (c.1500-1561), also Luys Milán, come from his Libro de música de vihuela de mano intitulado El Maestro (1536). One of the first published music collections for the vihuela de mano. There are many editions of this music available but this edition focuses on voice leading and legato connection in imitation of vocal works of the era. Low quality editions often ignore the vocal quality and complexity of the music resulting in fingering choices that simplify the music to the point chord playing. This edition has been fingered specifically to create beautiful musical lines and voice independence. This doesn't always make for easy fingerings but the musical result is worth it.

 Classical guitars are our passion! We are specialized in the highest quality concert guitars as well as historic guitars from around the world. Our passion for these unique instruments and the joy to give guitarists, passionate players, and collectors the possibility to purchase their own appropriate instrument is the motivation that drives us. Another focus is to work closely with established and young, largely unknown luthiers. Together we want to develop new ideas and share experiences with our customers. We also recorded pieces for many great composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Astor Piazzolla and Isaac Albeniz (Asturias). You will also find almost all the classical music composers that wrote for the classical guitar. Make sure to discover Agustin Barrios Mangoré, Manuel Maria Ponce, Heitor Villa-Lobos and many more if you don't know their compositions already You can find our showroom in 76137 Karlsruhe, Roonstr. 31, Germany

I was obsessed with this piece as a young guitarist. The perpetual right-hand movement and exciting passage work make for a truly addictive musical experience. 



This piece is often thought of as a tremolo piece, or at least on the way towards a full tremolo. However, with some creative right-hand adjustments, it can be a comprehensive workout for a number of left- and right-hand techniques.

Sometime between 2003 or 2004, Jorge Morel told me that he was working on a short piece that he intended to dedicate to Bill Bay, his publisher. He described it as an Etude written in a style reminiscent of Bluegrass. Staccato Dance is that piece. Indeed, it is an etude that targets a right hand pattern (P-I-MA), with brief interspersions of Campanella-like textures which, due to their dazzling speed, are reminiscent of Bluegrass. 

It has been almost 5 months since Jorge Morel's passing. As someone who served as inspiration to many guitarists throughout the world, and whom I personally looked up to as an artist and human being, I feel forever fortunate to have the rich heritage of his music with which to remember him.

passed away and as a guitar player you're going to listen
to some of his arrangements. I transcribed this for a friend 
of mine but hearing Julian Bream play this piece, it really
came to life for me. So, together with the presentation
of this special guitar that I restored, here it is.

Eladio Molina is a Malaga based guitarreros who won
some prizes during his career. Influenced by de Lorca
(e.g. the headform) he probably built this one somewhat 
later in his career. I'm curious to learn wether if there are
more people who posess a guitar from him as well.
Very few instruments are known to have survived from 
him. To my opinion I do not think this is the original sound-
board but anyway: A piece of History out of Malaga!

Gary Ryan) on Classical Guitar,"Milonga for 3, from the album ""The Rough Dancer and the Cyclical Night (Tango Apasionado),"" 1987. The piece originally was written for accompanied bandoneon, and relies heavily on long, sustained melodic lines almost like a song that are simply not possible on guitar. Gary Ryan's arrangement avoids attempting a note-for-note replication, and instead mixes and matches different themes and ideas from both the melody and accompaniment in an attempt to recreate the idea of the piece from within the limits of the guitar. This all creates some fun puzzles for interpretation.

 Classical guitars are our passion! We are specialized in the highest quality concert guitars as well as historic guitars from around the world. Our passion for these unique instruments and the joy to give guitarists, passionate players, and collectors the possibility to purchase their own appropriate instrument is the motivation that drives us. Another focus is to work closely with established and young, largely unknown luthiers. Together we want to develop new ideas and share experiences with our customers. We also recorded pieces for many great composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Astor Piazzolla and Isaac Albeniz (Asturias). You will also find almost all the classical music composers that wrote for the classical guitar. Make sure to discover Agustin Barrios Mangoré, Manuel Maria Ponce, Heitor Villa-Lobos and many more if you don't know their compositions already You can find our showroom in 76137 Karlsruhe, Roonstr. 31, Germany

The first edition of the score is headed Sonata quasi una fantasia and the name ""Moonlight Sonata"" has its origins in remarks by the German music critic and poet Ludwig Rellstab. In 1832, five years after Beethoven's death, Rellstab likened the effect of the first movement to that of moonlight shining on Lake Lucerne, within ten years, the name Moonlight Sonata (Mordscheinsonate in German) was being used in German and English publications. Later in the 19th century, it could be said that the sonata was universally known by that name.

Variations on a Theme by Handel Op.107, Op. 107 by Mauro Giuliani (1781-1829). Sheet Music & Tab for Classical Guitar with both a Notation-Only Edition and Notation + TAB Edition. Left hand fingering. PDF Download.

Depending on the variation and your tempo I'd say the level is late-intermediate (Grade 7) in terms of basic playing but performing the whole work at a pro tempo is advanced (Grade 9-10). 

Variations on a Theme by Handel Op.107 is one of Giuliani's most popular set of variations. The theme comes from popularly nicknamed The Harmonious Blacksmith, the final movement, Air and variations, from Suite No. 5 in E major, HWV 430, for harpsichord by George Frideric Handel (1685-1759). Giuliani does not follow Handel's variations but simply uses the theme and writes his own set.

Classical guitars are our passion! We are specialized in the highest quality concert guitars as well as historic guitars from around the world. Our passion for these unique instruments and the joy to give guitarists, passionate players, and collectors the possibility to purchase their own appropriate instrument is the motivation that drives us. Another focus is to work closely with established and young, largely unknown luthiers. Together we want to develop new ideas and share experiences with our customers. 

We also recorded pieces for many great composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Astor Piazzolla and Isaac Albeniz (Asturias). You will also find almost all the classical music composers that wrote for the classical guitar. Make sure to discover Agustin Barrios Mangoré, Manuel Maria Ponce, Heitor Villa-Lobos and many more if you don't know their compositions already

You can find our show room in 76137 Karlsruhe, Roonstr. 31, Germany

Andreas Kirschner is one of the best and most sought-after German luthiers of double-top guitars. His philosophy as a guitar-maker is focused on the sound quality and on optimizing the tone of the classical guitar. He is therefore closely working with professional guitarists since many years in order to build an instrument that fulfils the artists’ expectations. His guitars are built with a high level of workmanship and rank among the finest double-top instruments.
This 2019 spruce double-top guitar came directly from A. Kirschner’s workshop. It is astonishing how little effort one needs to put into the right hand when playing this guitar, in order to produce a room-filling tone. The player has the feeling to be surrounded by the sound of this instrument. It also has a nice and consistent sustain over the registers, making this guitar a very balanced instrument. The richness of sound-colours is very impressive and minimal right-hand motion open whole new sound-possibilities. The high-quality Scheller tuners fit perfectly to this guitar and round off the overall picture of this outstanding instrument very nicely.

They are not, however, ""pastiche"" and, as Len Williams wrote, they all have that ""quality of the romantic heart which never loses touch with beauty."" Born in 1885, Barrios remained for all his life in Latin America where he stayed for long periods in different countries, giving concerts and composing. Having toured Europe only once in 1934-1936, he later settled in San Salvador where he spent his last five years as professor of guitar at the National Conservatoire. Much beloved by his students, disciples and friends, he had many great interest such as philosophy, languages, journalism, graphic art and poetry. He sad of himself, ""I am a brother to those medieval troubadours who, in their glories and despairs, suffered such romantic madness."" The introduction and beginning of the tremolo melody beautifully reflect the title Sueño en la Floresta (Dreams in the Magic Garden) and therefore we recorded it in the gardens, to the gentle accompaniment of the birds singing.""

FOR STUDENTS: keeping proper curvature in all of your left hand fingers is critical to play this piece. Also, notice that in the middle slur section I'm keeping my hand movements to a minimum. That ensures accuracy.

A menudo los caprichos de Legnani son considerados buenos vehículos para mejorar la técnica, pero más allá de eso son de excelente carácter dramático. Este es el Capricho No. 15. PARA ESTUDIANTES: es imperativo mantener curvatura en los dedos de la mano izquierda. Observen que en la segunda sección evito el movimiento excesivo de la mano. Esto da precisión.

Frank Wallace's recording OMAGGIO features music of Mompou, Villa-Lobos, Tárrega, Turina, de Falla and Wallace: http://gyremusic.com/products/omaggio/

Suite Compostelana by Federico Mompou concluded my senior recital at SF Conservatory of Music in 1974.  I fell in love with this evocative piece thanks to Segovia’s first recording, a rare LP that included two full suites, the Mompou as well as Suite in Modo Polonico by Tansman.  Like many of my generation, I was attracted to the complete suites and sonatas that Bream and Williams recorded in the 60’s. Segovia’s 1965 recording was a departure from his usual  miniatures and single movements.

I am not sure what each movement meant to Mompou or Segovia, but the Prelude is clearly an homage to Albeniz.  For me, it sets the mood of a beautiful and ancient landscape, mountainous, green and with rugged coastline to both the north and the west. The Coral (Chorale) is Mompou’s rendition of the tradition of singing in the great medieval Cathedral of Santiago, mythical home of the remains of St. James, patron saint of Spain and central attraction for the pilgrims over the past 1,000 years. The next three movements are exquisite lyrical and textural pieces—Cuna is a lullaby; Recitativo refers to a Baroque form that is inspired by speech rhythms and should be quite free and dramatic (many modern interpretations are too metrical); and Canción is the Spanish word for song… whether a lilting work song or a passionate personal expression is up to the performer. Muñeira is commonly a very fast 6/8 peasant’s dance from Galicia frequently performed on gaita, a local bagpipe, thus its frequent use of drones. Wikipedia says muñeira means millstone or miller’s wife, while others say the word comes from an Arabic name. Suffice it to say it is clearly of peasant, rural origin.

Though Segovia did show his love and respect for this piece by recording the entire suite, its lack of an over-arching shape has always bothered me. It seems weakened by too many slow movements in the middle and not enough development of form and content. The concluding peasant dance, though a relief from the multiple slow movements, comes abruptly to my ear. So you might ask why am I recording the piece now, 40 years later? Simply put, it’s a gorgeous collection of music and guitar writing. From a brief survey of other recordings, you will find my tempos somewhat faster than most in order to create an arc to the piece as a whole. I find many interpretations to be extremely cautions and pedantic. For example, the guitaristic opening phrase seldom has melodic shape and the upper drone is equally loud as the melody in many recordings.

Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, the eponymous subject of this work, is full of energy. It is one of the world’s great pilgrimage sites and longtime home of Música en Compostela, a festival where Segovia taught for many summers. I attended the masterclass in 1972; when my wife-to-be, Nancy Knowles, was there in 1977 we decided in a transatlantic phone call to get married. We returned with John Fleagle in 1982 to perform a concert of medieval music for the Música en Compostela festival with our ensemble Trio LiveOak.

Solveig Kirschner – 2019

https://www.siccasguitars.com/shop/guitar/solveig-kirschner-2019/


Solveig studied lutherie at the State School of Musical Instrument Making in Mittenwald/Germany and now lives and works in Niedenstein/Germany, where she and her husband Andreas run a joint guitar workshop where her wonderful guitars are made. She only builds four to five guitars a year, but with the highest devotion and precision, creating breathtakingly beautiful instruments. Solveig’s guitars are traditionally built, very light and impressively powerful. Typical for her instruments is the charming and elegant sound of the trebles, which in combination with perfect balance and long sustain results in a fantastic singing guitar.
This beautiful guitar was built in 2019 and delivered by Solveig Kirschner during the 2019 Antwerp Guitar Festival. It is a love at first play, and we were not the only ones to think so. Solveig’s guitars made a really good impression during the sound comparison at the festival and we are now pleased to offer one of her instruments in our shop. The playability of this guitar is fantastic, and its volume is more than satisfying for any concert player. Moreover, the rich sound and warm depth of the basses make it an inspiring guitar that meets all the requirements of a first-class instrument.

Méthode Complète pour la Guitare - Paris, 1851",,,-wv-xf05KE0,31,103,Etude 24 by Napoleon Coste,,Jw1wc,Andante in D minor | Etude 24 | Napoleon Coste | Thu Le Classical Guitar,"Napoléon Coste was born in Amondans (Doubs), near Besançon, France. He was first taught the guitar by his mother, an accomplished player. As a teenager he became a teacher of the instrument and appeared in three concerts in the Franche-Comté. In 1829, at the age of 24, he moved to Paris where he studied under Fernando Sor and quickly established himself as the leading French virtuoso guitarist [source: Ari van Vliet: Napoléon Coste, Biography, 2016]. However, the demand for guitarists was in decline and, though his brilliance provided financial stability, he published many of his works by himself, which was customary at the time, apart from finding publishers for his music. As such, he had to fund his publications himself. Napoléon Coste was influenced by the Early Classical-Romantic composers of the time including Hector Berlioz. Coste's Opus no.47, La Source du Lyson is inspired by nature much like Berlioz's program music.

Coste injured his left shoulder in 1863 as a result of an accident, which didn't bring his performing career to a premature end because he performed in public until 1881. After Sor's death, Coste edited and republished Sor's original method for guitar as Méthode complète pour la Guitare par Ferdinand Sor, rédigée et augmentée [refingered and expanded] de nombreux exemples et leçons par N. Coste.

He had a special fondness for playing on a seven string guitar. He is known as one of the first composers to transcribe guitar music of the 17th century into modern musical notation. He died at age 77, leaving a significant catalogue of original compositions. Napoleon Coste was famous for his unique seven string guitar with a “floating” 7th string typically tuned to D or C called the Lacôte Heptachord. Tonally this invention created more depth when played as the floating string would vibrate sympathetically even as the other strings were plucked.

I would like to share my passion for classical guitar and inspire you with my music. 
Hopefully I can also add value to the community through my channel on YouTube. 
Go where the guitar takes you...

Hoy quería interpretaros esta farruca tan bonita de Sabicas, uno de mis guitarristas favoritos y una de las figuras más importantes para la guitarra flamenca. Se llama Punta y Tacón. Probablemente su título hace referencia a los pasos de la bailaora o el bailaor que baila la farruca, que suele usar para marcar los acentos la punta o el tacón. Es una de mis obras favoritas de la guitarra flamenca, espero que os guste mucho. 

Os dejo la obra de la que os hablo en el vídeo que yo misma compuse inspirada en la farruca y las bulerías, Cuando sabes que estás soñando: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Llf2uuFJErs

Recorded at Greg Smallman and sons Damon & Kym's workshop in Esperance, Western Australia.
On display in the Museum entrance hall is a 2020 Greg Smallman and sons Damon and Kym guitar.



""SOUNDING THE  CHANGE:
In mid-19th century Spain, Antonio Torres revolutionised guitar design and his innovations formed the basis of the modern classical guitar. Influential makers who followed made their own adaptations, and in Australia in the 2nd half of the century another revolutionary development occurred in the workshop of Greg Smallman. Smallman's key structural design innovation is a very light weight guitar top supported by internal ""lattice"" bracing.


Since 1981, the Smallman guitar has been the instrument of choice for renowned classical guitarist John Williams who praises the musicality that the Smallman guitar offers the guitarist.  

Greg Smallman and his sons, Damon and Kym, make guitars in Esperance, WA.""
- WA Museum Boola Bardip, Opening guide -

""Every recording engineer I've ever worked with whether you're playing on a film, you're playing with orchestra, and other musicians, they notice immediately. They always say: What's that guitar? Why is it easier to record? Why does it sound better?"" 
- John Williams - the guitarist

Giuliani's operatic influence can be heard very strongly in this D major study. This is the third study in Giuliani's Op.139: ""24 Prime Lezioni, Parte prima"" (24 First Lessons, Part 1). However, despite the title, only six studies were ever published in this collection–not 24 and no part 2!  

Giuliani's Op.139 Etude No.3 is reminiscent of a Mozart composition. The piece heavily features moving thirds in the upper voices, beautiful single line melodic phrases, slurs, and chromatic sequences similar to those found in Scarlatti works. Not only does this piece explore a wide range of the guitar both melodically and harmonically, but also demands a deliberate right and left hand approach. This etude can also be found in the popular ""Bridges - Guitar Repertoire and Etudes - Level 5"" edition (Study No.6).

 Classical guitars are our passion! We are specialized in the highest quality concert guitars as well as historic guitars from around the world. Our passion for these unique instruments and the joy to give guitarists, passionate players, and collectors the possibility to purchase their own appropriate instrument is the motivation that drives us. Another focus is to work closely with established and young, largely unknown luthiers. Together we want to develop new ideas and share experiences with our customers. We also recorded pieces for many great composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Astor Piazzolla and Isaac Albeniz (Asturias). You will also find almost all the classical music composers that wrote for the classical guitar. Make sure to discover Agustin Barrios Mangoré, Manuel Maria Ponce, Heitor Villa-Lobos and many more if you don't know their compositions already You can find our showroom in 76137 Karlsruhe, Roonstr. 31, Germany

My classical guitar lessons and acoustic guitar lessons will help you to learn to play the guitar. I cover a wide range of guitar music and each of my guitar lessons comes complete with matching guitar tabs and guitar sheet music. These online guitar tutorials are a one-stop shop giving you an effective means of learning beautiful guitar music without needing a teacher in your local area. 

You don't need to be able to read tab or sheet music to play any of the songs in these guitar lessons but they can be a powerful tool that can assist you to become a better musician. All guitar tabs for my lessons are free and can be downloaded easily from our website or for a very small fee you can also purchase the guitar sheet music that contains standard music notation with guitar tabs underneath, suggested left & right-hand fingerings, and performance indications. 

I hold a Licentiate in Performance Classical Guitar with Distinction from the Trinity College of London and I love arranging music for guitar. I have well over 20 years of teaching experience at many schools in New Zealand and also at one school in Dubai, and privately in Bahrain. I have taught people from all ages and skill levels and continue to do so via YouTube.

------------
What some have called the ""saddest Mozart piece ever"" for its wondrous portrayal of the cry of the human heart amid the depths of grief, Lacrimosa has an undertone of marching forward, the human impulse unstoppable, even in death. Out of the depths of mourning, we sense life itself--moving forward, overcoming great odds. Amid profound sadness, one can find hope in its soaring phrases. In this masterpiece, portraying the labor pains of this mortal life, we see death giving birth to life: both in generations to come and in life eternal.

Classical guitars are our passion! We are specialized in the highest quality concert guitars as well as historic guitars from around the world. Our passion for these unique instruments and the joy to give guitarists, passionate players, and collectors the possibility to purchase their own appropriate instrument is the motivation that drives us. Another focus is to work closely with established and young, largely unknown luthiers. Together we want to develop new ideas and share experiences with our customers. 

We also recorded pieces for many great composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Astor Piazzolla and Isaac Albeniz (Asturias). You will also find almost all the classical music composers that wrote for the classical guitar. Make sure to discover Agustin Barrios Mangoré, Manuel Maria Ponce, Heitor Villa-Lobos and many more if you don't know their compositions already

You can find our show room in 76137 Karlsruhe, Roonstr. 31, Germany

Jim Redgate is a highly sought-after Australian luthier, known for his guitars built for artists such as Ana Vidovic, Pepe Roméro and Odair Assad. This lattice-braced model is an exact copy of the guitar that Ana Vidovic plays. Jim Redgate’s instruments have their own sound and touch. The breath-taking volume combined with rich harmonics and impressive clarity of sound are quite unique. The playability is fantastic, and the guitars are relatively light in weight compared to the Australian standard.
We’ve of course heard Ana Vidovic in concert many times playing on a Redgate guitar, but this guitar convinced us even more of the quality of Jim’s work. The honesty and spontaneity of each note, the magnificent volume, the ease of playing, and the unique sound character of this guitar make it an instrument not only rare in Europe, but above all extremely enchanting.

Six Pavans by Luis de Milán (c.1500-1561) - Originally for vihuela. Sheet Music arranged for Classical Guitar with Notation-Only Edition, TAB Edition, and Unfingered Edition. Regular guitar tuning. Mixed levels (see link).

The six pavans (pavanes, or pavanas) by Luis de Milán (c.1500-1561), also Luys Milán, come from his Libro de música de vihuela de mano intitulado El Maestro (1536). One of the first published music collections for the vihuela de mano. There are many editions of this music available but this edition focuses on voice leading and legato connection in imitation of vocal works of the era. Low quality editions often ignore the vocal quality and complexity of the music resulting in fingering choices that simplify the music to the point chord playing. This edition has been fingered specifically to create beautiful musical lines and voice independence. This doesn't always make for easy fingerings but the musical result is worth it.

Translated lyrics of Estrellita:


Little star from the distant sky
That you look at my pain
That you know my suffering
Come down and tell me

========================
Ana Florencia, es una preciosa canción de cuna compuesta por Antonio Lauro, probablemente en un momento de gran inspiración y/o felicidad. La dedicó a Ana Florencia Gómez, de la cual no puedo precisar ningún dato exacto, pero bien podría ser una de sus nietas, pues acostumbraba a hacer este tipo de dedicatorias en otras piezas. Quizás el Maestro Rafael Suárez, gran conocedor de la vida y obra de Lauro, que ya en otras ocasiones me ha aportado valiosos datos, pudiera aclararnos su identidad y probable parentesco.
Como se puede comprobar, continúo otro domingo más con mis grabaciones caseras e improvisadas que tanto me entretienen, deseando que disfruten mucho con esta delicada música que he desempolvado, después de mucho tiempo, para tocarla hoy.


26-7-2017

Las amistades que se cosechan a través de la red y las satisfacciones que te proporcionan, son inmensas. Mi amigo el Maestro Eladio Mujica, me envía amable y muy generosamente una valiosa información, que completa sobremanera lo poco que yo sabía sobre esta pieza del Maestro Lauro, que grabé hace algunas semanas. Además, me envía un archivo en el que, con el sonido de este video de mi guitarra de fondo, canta él personalmente la canción y me envía un emotivo mensaje de texto, que entre otras cosas, de esta pieza me dice lo siguiente: "" la pieza original es para canto y guitarra, o sea, que tiene un texto. Ese poema, muy bello y emotivo, lo escribió un amigo del maestro Lauro, quien curiosamente fue un gran pintor venezolano llamado Ventura Gómez ,quien también nació en mi querida isla de Margarita. Este poema fue dedicado a su nieta, la niña Ana Florencia Gómez"".
El poema dice así:
Hadas de ensueño
la puerta abrid
que Ana Florencia
no quiere dormir
Ven a mis brazos
Anita flor
cierra los ojos
y duerme mi amor
tu cara inocente
risueña armonía
se tiñe de un suave
rubor de alegría
tras de la luna
se asoma el sol
despierta en mis brazos
al bien de mi amor
tu cara inocente...

Es maravilloso que puedan ocurrir cosas como estas. Y es que tiene mucho valor, que un amigo se ocupe de aportar tan bonita y valiosa información, máxime en estos difíciles momentos que se vive en el país.

Versión para Guitarra de Miguel Llobet

Bueno, luego de una breve interrupción en este ciclo de estilos, vuelvo para compartir este tema, que como forma de suplir la ausencia de una semana, trae varios nombres de importantes referentes de la Guitarra.

Tal como aclaro más arriba la versión para guitarra es de Miguel Llobet, guitarrista, compositor español nacido en Barcelona en 1878, pero que residió en Buenos Aires en reiterados periodos de tiempo. Fue discípulo de Francisco Tarrega y se le adjudica haber sido Maestro de Andrés Segovia. Una de sus alumnas más destacadas fue María Luisa Anido.

Esta armonización para Guitarra Llobet la hizo según la versión de Pedro M. Quijano, guitarrista, compositor y profesor, nacido en Salta en 1875 quien en 1887 ingresa al conservatorio nacional en Buenos Aires donde reside hasta su fallecimiento en 1944. 

Domingo Prat, guitarrista, compositor y maestro de guitarra nacido en Barcelona en 1886 quien en 1907 llega a Buenos Aires y dio a conocer en la Argentina la escuela moderna de la Guitarra, habla en su Diccionario de la Guitarra (1934) habla sobre Quijano lo destaca como compositor e interprete que se nutrió de los más famosos payadores y guitarrista de aquella época como Juan Alais, Gabino Ezeiza entre otros.

Espero que les guste y dejo aquí la lista de los guitarristas que nombre en este breve escrito y que de una u otra manera son parte de esta bagaje enorme que traen consigo los Estilos.

Another focus is to work closely with established and young, largely unknown luthiers. Together we want to develop new ideas and share experiences with our customers. We also recorded pieces for many great composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Astor Piazzolla and Isaac Albeniz (Asturias).

Johann Sebastian Bach",,,w90l3igRIu8,50,105.0,BWV996 Bourree in E Minor by Johann Sebastian Bach,,2D1wc,Bourree In E minor | Johann Sebastian Bach | NBN Guitar,"Bach wrote many pieces for lute including the Bourrée in E-minor which is especially popular amongst guitarists. The piece forms part of a larger baroque 'Suite in E minor BWV996'.

I first learned this piece many years ago when I was still quite new to the guitar. From memory I learned it going into my second year of guitar study after watching Yngwie Malmsteen play it during a concert on television.

This is a great example of contrapuntal writing whereby 2 distinct melodic lines play simultaneously. When playing it's important to keep the lines separate where required and not to let one overpower the other.

My classical guitar lessons and acoustic guitar lessons will help you to learn to play the guitar. I cover a wide range of guitar music and each of my guitar lessons comes complete with matching guitar tabs and guitar sheet music. These online guitar tutorials are a one-stop shop giving you an effective means of learning beautiful guitar music without needing a teacher in your local area. 

You don't need to be able to read tab or sheet music to play any of the songs in these guitar lessons but they can be a powerful tool that can assist you to become a better musician. All guitar tabs for my lessons are free and can be downloaded easily from our website or for a very small fee you can also purchase the guitar sheet music that contains standard music notation with guitar tabs underneath, suggested left & right-hand fingerings, and performance indications. 

I hold a Licentiate in Performance Classical Guitar with Distinction from the Trinity College of London and I love arranging music for guitar. I have well over 20 years of teaching experience at many schools in New Zealand and also at one school in Dubai, and privately in Bahrain. I have taught people from all ages and skill levels and continue to do so via YouTube.

Bach - BWV 1004 Sarabande (Solo Guitar Arrangement),"Of all the music in my repertoire, this beautiful Sarabande by J.S. Bach is one of my very favorite pieces. I think one of the reasons I enjoy playing it so much is because it is like a musical meditation or like yoga for the spirit and soul, and it really helps to keep or restall inner piece... It is a modest but profound and sacred master piece of baroque music, even a bit romantic and quite modern, so in a way it is what I would describe as timeless and progressive (well, let's say it has all the noble qualities that I would like modern music to have, but that's a different story... ;)
